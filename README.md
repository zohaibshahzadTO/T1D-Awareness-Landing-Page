This is new landing page I've created for a new project I'm working on. 

# Project - About

T1D Awareness' goal is to bring accurate awareness for Type 1 Diabetes to the general public with the purpose of stopping missed or delayed diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes, which can lead to permanent disabilities or death. 

In addition, T1D Awareness also designs high quality apparel pertaining to Type 1 Diabetes that is screen-printed by hand in the USA; a portion of the profit made through the apparel will be donated to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).

Front End Tech Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (JQuery)
